# tic-tac-toe

An on-the-fly coding interview problem I did.

It actually works!  I never implemented something as silly as tic tac toe, but I did it for this on-site job interview, right in front of the interviewer.  We played an example game with it together, and it worked, and he had nothing to say.  I can't believe I used NumPy arrays instead of just maybe an array of arrays.
